# DECISIONS

## 2026-09-30 — Requirements path normalization
- **Context:** `PLAN.md` requires `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` as the requirements source of truth, while the repository had `Requirements.md` at root.
- **Decision:** Moved the file to `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` without changing content.
- **Consequences:** Plan and automation can consistently read requirements from a stable path.

## 2026-09-30 — M0 tooling baseline
- **Context:** The repository had no app scaffold or verification tooling required by M0.
- **Decision:** Added a Vite + React + TypeScript strict scaffold with ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, Playwright, and `scripts/verify.sh` as the initial gate.
- **Consequences:** We now have a deterministic baseline to grow milestone-by-milestone, with a single command to validate each iteration.
