## Iteration Log

### 2026-10-01 — M2/M3 slice
- Added a real markdown-to-plain renderer using the Marked lexer (AST-like token walk), chunking with safe rejoin semantics, and a true DOCX converter via Mammoth.
- Expanded the app shell to handle multiple files, batch modes, edit mode, copy/download fallback, warnings, and persisted settings.
- Added DOCX unit and Playwright tests using generated docx fixtures from `docx`.
- Verification evidence:
  - `npx vitest run tests/unit/core/plain.test.ts tests/unit/core/chunk.test.ts tests/unit/converters/docx.test.ts` ✅ failed before implementation, then passed after the fix.
  - `npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=line` ✅ on the updated browser suite after installing Chromium.
- Next steps:
  - Continue by implementing the broader PDF/XLSX/PPTX/OCR families and the remaining plan-specified privacy and accessibility gates.
- Blockers: none in this environment.
